I realised recently that I spend a lot of time thinking about blog post titles, themes, topics, formats, etc. I spend so much time thinking about how to make a "proper blog" and nowhere near enough time just fucking writing and figuring it out as I go. Nobody cares. You learn more from writing 100 shitty blogposts (you are reading one) than from thinking about the *perfect* one.

I distinctly remember having written a similar sentence as the one above in an old blog. I'm not great at following my own advice.

Today our first batch of eggs hatched, eight little feathery chicks and counting. It was a lot of fun to watch them break out of the eggs, which I learned is called "pipping" and it's a lot of fun to say. We've tried breeding chicks the way God intended before with very little success. The only time we got chicks was when we were away on holidays and didn't even know one hen had a secret stash of eggs outisde the coop.

The incubator my wife found worked pretty well. It controls the temperature and humidity, it rotates the eggs (it could be a little quieter) and it has a clear cover that allows you to see the whole process, which is great for children. And it doesn't pull a lot of power, so we could leave it on at night (we're off-grid solar).

We're still waiting for a couple more chicken eggs and three duck eggs (one exploded, it was disgusting to clean), which should hatch in a week or so. All chicks are in a box with food, water and an electric heater.

I listened to a great [interview with Craig Mod on the Tim Ferriss podcast](https://tim.blog/2025/03/28/craig-mod-returns/). He talks about doing long distance walks in Japan, living in Japan, writing and self-publishing books, parenthood and tells an amazing story about being adopted. I've been following Mod for a while, I find his work very inspiring. The way he describes his experience doing these walks is identical to what I experience doing the Camino de Santiago, which I fondly remember as one of the best experiences of my life. It's great encouragement to get back into long walks, especially since I know live in an area where that's very much accessible.

I've ordered Craig's book ["Things become other things"](https://craigmod.com/books/things_become_other_things/) and I've queued up [his other interview with Tim Ferriss](https://tim.blog/2025/03/27/craig-mod/).
