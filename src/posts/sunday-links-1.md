1. [A physical exploded view of a watch cast in resin](https://fellerts.no/projects/epoch.html). Amazing project, great documentation. I'm pretty sure Hannibal did that to a person once.

2. The term "advice pollution" from [this Guardian article on quitting social media](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/01/ready-to-give-up-social-media-advice-pollution-might-just-get-you-there). 

I'm not sure I agree with the columnist, I think the internet has always been an opinionated space, and that's a good thing. To me the issue and why I find "advice pollution" so annoying/depressing/cringe-worthy is that the opinionated-ness is not honest, it's just posturing to try to gain the favour of the algorithmic gods. I'm happy to hear your opinions, but it has to come from a shitty website you maintain and through my RSS reader.

3. A list of [Obscure But Badass Folks You Should Know About](https://www.neatorama.com/2025/09/01/Obscure-But-Badass-Folks-You-Should-Know-About). God I miss Cracked.com. Luckily for me, ex-editor-in-chief Jason Pargin is publishing some good ol' Cracked-style (David Wong-style) rants on [his YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@JasonKPargin). I honestly remember some Cracked articles from like 2012 that literally changed my life and the way I view the world.

4. Trailer for the new Kathryn Bigelow film "The House of Dynamite". Absolutely my jam.

5. [Wintzards of the Coast](https://bsky.app/profile/drilmagic.bsky.social): a Bluesky account that mashes up Magic The Gathering cards with tweets from [wint (@dril)](https://x.com/dril?). You have to see it to believe it.
